Here is a **Post-Incident Response Report** based on the RDP brute-force attack detection, mapped to the **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2** Incident Response Framework, and informed by your screenshots and lab context:

---

#  **Post-Incident Response Report – Day 10: Windows RDP Brute Force Attack**

###  **Incident Type**: Unauthorized Login Attempt (Brute Force via RDP)

---

##  **Mapped to NIST IR Process**

### **1. Preparation**

*  RDP was enabled and properly configured on Windows Server 2025.
*  Security auditing was active with Event ID **4625 (Failed Logon)** being logged.
*  Firewall rules allowed RDP access (TCP 3389) to simulate real-world exposure.

---

### **2. Detection and Analysis**

### **Detection Method**:

* Alert generated by **Event ID 4625** in Event Viewer under:
  `Windows Logs → Security`

### **Log Details (From Screenshot)**:

* **TargetUserName**: `Administrator`
* **Failure Reason**: `%%2313 (Unknown user name or bad password)`
* **Logon Type**: `3` (Network logon)
* **Authentication Package**: `NTLM`
* **Workstation Name**: `kali`
* **IP Address**: `192.168.57.135` (Attacker's Kali VM)

### **Analysis**:

* Multiple failed logins were observed in quick succession.
* Attempts originated from the same IP address (`192.168.57.135`), indicating a brute-force pattern.
* No successful login was observed.

---

### **3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**

#### **Containment**

* The attacker's IP was blocked using a Windows Firewall rule:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Attacker" -Direction Inbound -RemoteAddress 192.168.57.135 -Action Block
```

#### **Eradication**

* Account targeted (`Administrator`) was audited.
* No malware or persistence mechanisms (e.g., scheduled tasks) were found on the system.
* Optionally, user account could be locked:

```powershell
net user administrator /active:no
```

#### **Recovery**

* System reviewed for any unauthorized changes — none found.
* Firewall and audit logs exported for records.
* Security policy reviewed to enforce account lockout policy for failed attempts.

---

### **4. Post-Incident Activity**

#### **Summary**:

* Simulated brute-force attack detected via failed RDP logons.
* Source IP confirmed as `192.168.57.135` from Kali machine.
* PowerShell used to block the attacker's IP.
* No signs of successful compromise found.

#### **Recommendations**:

* Implement **account lockout policy** (e.g., after 5 failed attempts).
* Limit RDP exposure using:

  * Network segmentation
  * IP whitelisting
  * VPN access
* Monitor Event ID **4625** and correlate with threat intel feeds.
* Enable enhanced logging (e.g., via Sysmon or EDR solutions).

### **Incident Timeline**

| **Time**    | **Action**                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12:00:06 AM | Multiple failed login attempts recorded (Event ID 4625) |
| 12:01 AM    | IP `192.168.57.135` identified as source of attack      |
| 12:02 AM    | Administrator user flagged as target                    |
| 12:03 AM    | IP blocked via firewall using PowerShell                |
| 12:05 AM    | Incident documented and logs exported                   |

 **Conclusion**
This lab demonstrated how to detect a simulated RDP brute-force attack using Windows Event Viewer, identify attacker details (IP, user target), and take immediate response actions using native Windows tools — essential practices for SOC analysts handling Windows-based intrusions.
